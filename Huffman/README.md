To test the HuffmanSubmit program, encode a file and then decode it, using the encode() and decode() functions. This project compressed files using the Huffman algorithm. The Huffman algorithm finds the frequency of bytes in a file, and then creates lower bit codes the higher the frequency of the item. For example, if byte 01010101 occured 300 times, it might have a code like 101, while byte 01010111, occurring 3 times, might have a code like 1000111. This allows for higher frequency items to take up less space in the compressed file, however it does require a reference file to "unzip". The Huffman algorithm creates these codes using a binary tree. To unzip, a similar process is done in reverse. The binary tree is looped through, using the bits from the file to decide whether to go left or right. Once a leaf is reached, that was an original value, so the original value is added to the decoded file. This continues until the entire file is complete.
