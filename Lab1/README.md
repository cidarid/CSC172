This lab checked if words were either anagrams or rotations of each other. To check if the two words are anagrams, I looped through character by character and checked that for each character, both strings had it. To check if the two words are rotations, I added one of the strings to itself and checked if the second string was contained in the "double string". To run the program, execute the main() method.
