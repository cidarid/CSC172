This lab manipulated arrays and generics created from those arrays. I wrote three different printArray methods: printArrayNonGen to print a passed array to the console without generics; a printArray method that used overloading to handle Integer[], Double[], Character[], and String[]; and a printArrayGen that printed a passed generic object. Then, I wrote a getMax method that takes an array and outputs the max object in that array. Finally, I wrote a getMaxGen method that takes a generic array and outputs the max object in that array. To run the program, execute the main() method.
