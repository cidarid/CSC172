In this lab, arrays and lists were manipulated in various ways. First, I made a function that printed a 2D array in a table format, and then made a function that did the same thing but for a 2D ArrayList. Second, I wrote a function that created a "running sum" version of an inputted 2D array, where the direction to do the running sum in is passed as a number (1: left, 2: right, 3: up, 4: down). It then sums all the numbers in that direction, i.e. going down for a row 1, 2, 3, 4 would result in a row of 1, 3, 6, 10. Finally, I wrote different methods to print out ArrayLists. The first method was a simple for loop, that ran ArrayList.size times and printed out all the items in the list. The second was a for-each loop, that went through every Integer in the list and printed it out. The for loop with iterator (which is essentially what the for-each loop is) goes through the passed list while there are items remaining, and prints all those items out. I then made a while loop iterator function that does more or less the same thing, but instead of using the for loop counter (i), it uses the .getNext function and keeps looping while there is a remaining next value.
