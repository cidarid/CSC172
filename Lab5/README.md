In this lab, I created a trie to store binary strings. It has 7 main functions. Insert takes a parameter string and inserts it into the trie. Search takes a parameter string and searches for it into the trie, returning either the original string or the closest string lexicographically. Print prints the trie from smallest to largest. Largest outputs the largest node in the trie. Smallest outputs the smallest node in the trie. Height outputs the height of the trie. Size outputs how many nodes there are in the trie.
